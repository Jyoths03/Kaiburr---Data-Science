# Task 5 - Data Science: Text Classification (Demo)
This demo trains a multi-class text classifier on a small synthetic dataset to mimic the consumer complaint categories:
0 Credit reporting, repair, or other
1 Debt collection
2 Consumer Loan
3 Mortgage

The script trains a model, compares two simple classifiers, and outputs evaluation metrics and a small sample prediction file.
